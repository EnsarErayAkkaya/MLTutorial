## Regression
  In regression what we need to do is finding **best slope** for given linear data set. So how can we find the best slope?
  If we think data as x set and y set like in the given image,
  
  ![example data set](https://github.com/EnsarErayAkkaya/MLTutorial/blob/master/Regression/Images/RegressionExampleDataSet.jpg)
  
  We can calculate best slope with following function
