## Regression
  In regression what we need to do is finding **Best Slope** for given linear data set. So how can we find the best slope?
  If we think data as x set and y set like in the given image,
  
  ![example data set](https://github.com/EnsarErayAkkaya/MLTutorial/blob/master/Regression/Images/RegressionExampleDataSet.jpg)
  
  We can calculate best slope with following function
  
  ![BestSlope](https://github.com/EnsarErayAkkaya/MLTutorial/blob/master/Regression/Images/RegressionMSlope.jpg)
  
  This expression means that avarage of all Xs

  Now we need to calculate **Y intercept**, formula of intercept is 
  ![Mean X](https://github.com/EnsarErayAkkaya/MLTutorial/blob/master/Regression/Images/RegressionYIntercept.jpg)
  
  #### Now Finally our function is ready, we can calculate every y for every is with
   ### x y = mx +
